# Geospatial-Analysis
# Summary
In my Geospatial Analysis project, I explored the dining landscape using Zomato's restaurant data, focusing on understanding geographical distribution patterns, dining preferences, and identifying potential growth areas for new establishments. By utilizing geospatial techniques alongside text analysis methods like unigram, bigram, and trigram analysis, I aimed to uncover hidden insights about popular cuisines, customer sentiments, and the relationship between location and restaurant success. This project provided actionable recommendations for restaurateurs and investors seeking to optimize their market strategies and expand in underserved areas.

# Problem Statement
The food industry is highly competitive, with restaurants vying for attention in saturated urban markets. Businesses face challenges in understanding the geographical patterns that influence dining preferences and in identifying locations that promise success. I aimed to solve the problem of determining optimal restaurant locations by analyzing Zomato's data. My goal was to utilize geospatial analysis to reveal patterns and insights that traditional approaches might overlook, focusing on the relationship between cuisine popularity, location, and restaurant performance.

# Methodology
I employed a structured approach that integrated geospatial analysis with natural language processing techniques to analyze Zomato's restaurant data comprehensively. Here's a breakdown of my methodology:

# Data Collection:
Extracted restaurant data, including attributes such as restaurant names, locations (latitude and longitude), cuisines, user reviews, ratings, and pricing information.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Performed data cleaning to remove duplicates, fill in missing values, and format data for analysis.
Used geocoding to convert address details into spatial coordinates for mapping purposes.

# Geospatial Analysis:
Utilized GIS tools and Python libraries to visualize restaurant distributions on maps.
Conducted spatial clustering to identify restaurant density hotspots and potential opportunity zones for new establishments.

# Text Analysis:
Implemented unigram, bigram, and trigram analysis on user reviews to extract key phrases and common expressions.
Leveraged the nltk and spaCy libraries to preprocess text data and identify frequently mentioned keywords, phrases, and customer sentiments.

# Culinary Trend Analysis:
Identified popular and emerging cuisines through frequency analysis of menu items and customer reviews.
Analyzed correlations between cuisine popularity, geographic location, and restaurant success to identify niche markets.

# Visualization:
Created interactive heatmaps using Folium to highlight high-density restaurant areas.
Visualized text analysis results with word clouds and bar charts to depict trending unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.

# Skills
Throughout the project, I utilized and honed several key skills:

Python Programming: Used Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implemented NLP techniques to extract insights from textual data using unigram, bigram, and trigram analysis.

Data Visualization: Created visual representations of data insights using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Statistical Analysis: Analyzed correlations and trends to derive meaningful insights from data patterns.
